### Purpose
This repositoru grew out of a desire to learn and mess around with Apache Spark without installing a bunch of stuff directly on my machine. I figured someone must have done this before and had a docker container already set up. I could not find wta I wanted so I made it.

This container starts with Alpine Linux, installs OpenJDK 11 and Spark 3.1.2.
